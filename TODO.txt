1. Design an eventing system that can handle:
	- Deathrattles
	- Card powers (like Undertaker)
	- Attacking

	- Hey, Blessing of Wisdom and Soul of the Forest stacks!!!
	- Interesting interaction with Inner Rage and Pyromancer. Inner Rage will actually kill the Pyromancer without triggering 
      Pyromancer's triggered effect.
	- What happens when a Haunted Creeper and an Abomination kill each other?
		- Theory says that whichever was played first will trigger their deathrattle first
		- e.g. If haunted creeper was played first, then it will spawn spiders, and then abom rattle will kill the spiders
		- However, I'm wondering if it is more based on who attacked first.
		- e.g. Haunted creepr was played first, but abom initiated the attack and killed the creeper.
			This the creeper dies but before it dies, it also kills the abomination. The abomination then death rattles, doing 2 damage
			and finally the creeper spiders spawn.
		- If it's the former, then we'll probably have to do something like keep a list of creatures that have died that turn and then
			trigger the deathrattles for each dead creature in the correct order (in which the creatures were played).

2. Implement some sample cards

3. Get a sample game working

4. Implement the log reading
